## Hyper-V support

This release comes with an integration for Hyper-V. Searching for connections on a system where Hyper-V is installed should automatically add connections to your VMs. Note that Hyper-V requires Administrator privileges to interact with the VMs, so you have to start XPipe as an administrator if accessing a local Hyper-V VM and login as a user with Administrator privileges if you're accessing a remote Hyper-V instance.

XPipe can connect to a VM via PSSession or SSH. PSSession is used by default for Windows guests if no SSH server is available on the guest. In all other cases, it will try to connect via SSH. Since Hyper-V cannot run guest commands on non-Windows systems from the outside, you have to make sure that an SSH server is already running in the VM in that case.
